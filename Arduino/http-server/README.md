# About the project

Project raised as the HTTP server to serve the HTML page and it's assets stored as consts in the header file. The header file was generated by the GULP and assets habe been minified and all stored as a String in the const in the `./include/w3front.hpp` which was generated by the `./www/templates/w3front.ejs` template.

So the aim was to serve specific page which will POST requests back to the Arduino to do other hardware related tasks. The goal was to controll the LTP port.

## The Flaw

I realised that the UIPEthernet library is quite hungry for SRAM whare on Arduino UNO is 2KB available only. With any other library and managing code it is impossible to finish this project.
