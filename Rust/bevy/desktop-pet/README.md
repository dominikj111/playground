# Desktop-Pet Game Architecture

Desktop-Pet is a game project structured with a modular architecture, focusing on separation of concerns and reusability. The project is organized into three main components: the engine core, shared utilities, and specialized applications.

## Project Structure

```
desktop-pet/
├── engine/     # Core game engine implementation
├── shared/     # Common utilities and support functions
└── apps/       # Specialized applications and test environments
```

## Components

### Engine Crate
The engine is the heart of the project, containing the core game implementation. It handles:
- Game loop and state management
- Physics and collision detection
- Entity management system
- Rendering pipeline
- Core game mechanics

### Shared Crate
The shared crate provides common utilities and support functions used across the engine and applications:
- Common data structures
- Utility functions
- Shared constants and configurations
- Helper modules for common operations

### Apps
The apps directory contains various sub-applications that utilize the engine crate for specific purposes:

## Architecture Benefits

This modular architecture provides several advantages:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable core engine functionality
- Isolated testing environments
- Easy addition of new test scenarios
- Maintainable and scalable codebase

## Development Workflow

When developing new features or mechanics:
1. Implement core functionality in the engine crate
2. Add necessary utilities to the shared crate
3. Create or use existing apps for testing and refinement
4. Iterate based on testing results

## Getting Started

[Documentation for setting up the development environment and running different applications will be added here]
