This my personal Rust playground to learn Rust, WebAssembly and more.

I have here bunch of examples to get started and will add more in time.

I never did anything in Rust, but I know it and I know how to start work with it. I would like to start using Rust for node.js modules, webassembly and to build cli tools ... maybe to do simple games as well and to work with Tauri (because I'm web developer most of the time). Know I decided to start learning the language self, I would expect to know how to write algorithm, parallel processing, how to call system libraries and interact with database. Also I would to have some nice output, not only text in the cli. And better to do something I'll able to reuse in future to don't typing the code just blindly. Can you suggest 15 tasks which will grow in complexity and where I can gain language knoledge properly?

Sure, here are 15 tasks you can work on to gain Rust knowledge:

Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
Write a program that takes user input and prints it to the console.
Write a program that reads a file and prints its contents to the console.
Write a program that reads multiple files and combines their contents into a single file.
Write a program that creates a HTTP server and responds to requests with "Hello, World!".
Write a program that connects to a database and retrieves data.
Write a program that creates a database and inserts data.
Write a program that generates a random number and prints it to the console.
Write a program that sorts an array of integers.
Write a program that implements a binary search algorithm.
Write a program that encrypts and decrypts a message using a Caesar cipher.
Write a program that implements a parallel map-reduce algorithm.
Write a program that interacts with a system library, such as libc.
Write a program that creates a GUI using a Rust GUI library, such as GTK or Qt.
Write a program that implements a game, such as Tic Tac Toe or Snake.
These tasks range in complexity and cover a variety of topics, including file I/O, networking, databases, algorithms, parallel processing, system libraries, GUI programming, and game development. Working on these tasks will give you a solid foundation in Rust and help you gain the skills you need to build more complex applications.

Nice! Does Rust have any libraies to do Matrix/Vector calculation, statistics, generate and store images?

Yes, Rust has several libraries for matrix and vector calculation, statistics, and image processing. Here are some popular libraries you can use:

ndarray: a library for n-dimensional array computations, including matrix and vector operations.
nalgebra: a linear algebra library for general-purpose computations with vectors, matrices, and quaternions.
statistics: a library for statistical analysis and testing, including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
rand: a library for random number generation and sampling.
image: a library for image processing and generation, including reading and writing various image formats, color space conversion, and filtering.
These libraries are all well-documented and have active communities, so you should be able to find plenty of examples and tutorials to help you get started.


Is there any library to do fractals or game of life automata in Rust?
Yes, there are several Rust libraries available for creating fractals and game of life automata. Some of the popular Rust libraries for fractals are:

image: for generating images of fractals
fractal_rs: for generating Mandelbrot and Julia sets
easy_canvas: for creating animations of fractals
For game of life automata, you can use the gol crate. This crate provides a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.



Is there any library to communicate via Bluetooth, Ethernet, Serial port?
