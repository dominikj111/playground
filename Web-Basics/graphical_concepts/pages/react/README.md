# React Counter Demo

A simple demonstration of React (Preact) functionality within the Graphical
Concepts project. This demo showcases:

- Basic React component structure
- State management using hooks (`useState`)
- Event handling
- Tailwind CSS styling

## Technical Details

- Uses Preact 10.25.4 as a lightweight alternative to React
- Implements a counter with increment/decrement functionality
- Built and bundled using esbuild
- Styled using Tailwind CSS

## File Structure

- `index.tsx` - Main React component with counter logic
- `index.html` - HTML entry point that loads and renders the React component

## How It Works

The demo presents a simple counter interface where users can:

- View the current count
- Increment the count using the blue button
- Decrement the count using the red button
