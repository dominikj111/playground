# Chat Sessions Initial Document

## Purpose

This repository is a personal Python interview training workspace for a senior software developer / full-stack developer position.

The project exists to practice Python fundamentals, algorithms, testing, typing, concurrency, web APIs, architecture, and interview-sized implementation projects in a structured way.

## Invariants

Never violate these constraints:

* Keep exercises small, focused, and interview-oriented.
* Prefer readable, idiomatic Python over clever solutions.
* Every non-trivial solution should be testable with `pytest`.
* Shared utilities belong in `shared/pyutils/`; do not duplicate the same helper across exercises.
* Exercise directories should be numbered and named consistently: `001_hello_world`, `002_temperature_converter`, etc.
* Do not turn this repository into a production application; it is a practice and preparation workspace.
* Do not add heavyweight frameworks unless an exercise specifically requires them.
* Keep dependency changes in `environment.yml`.

## Documentation Map

Repository documentation starts from these files only:

* `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` — identical documents, agent rules and project constraints.
* `Problems.md` — master roadmap of interview practice problems.
* `environment.yml` — Conda environment definition.
* `README.md` — human-facing project overview, if present.

Optional documentation may live in:

* `docs/index.md` — documentation entry point, if `docs/` exists.
* `problems/<number_name>/README.md` — individual exercise statement.
* `shared/README.md` — shared utility package notes, if present.

Documentation discovery starts from the smallest relevant entry point. Do not recursively read all documentation.

## Repository Shape

Expected structure:

```text
python-training/
├── AGENTS.md
├── CLAUDE.md
├── Problems.md
├── environment.yml
├── README.md
├── problem_seed/
├── shared/
│   ├── pyutils/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── collections.py
│   │   ├── config.py
│   │   ├── files.py
│   │   ├── io.py
│   │   ├── json.py
│   │   ├── logging.py
│   │   ├── strings.py
│   │   ├── time.py
│   │   └── validation.py
│   ├── tests/
│   └── pyproject.toml
└── problems/
    ├── 001_hello_world/
    │   ├── solution.py
    │   └── tests/
    └── ...
```

Create this structure incrementally. Do not create empty directories or broad documentation trees unless needed for the active task.

## Exercise Format

Each exercise should contain, when useful:

* problem statement
* requirements
* examples
* constraints and edge cases
* hints
* solution
* tests
* discussion
* possible improvements
* interview notes

Keep early exercises lightweight. Add more structure as problems become more realistic.

## Python Environment

Use the Conda environment defined by `environment.yml`.

Common commands:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate python-playground
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
python --version
pytest
ruff check .
mypy .
```

Prefer `conda` packages from `conda-forge`. Use `pip` only for packages unavailable or more practical through PyPI, such as type stubs.

## Coding Standards

Follow these defaults unless an exercise says otherwise:

* Python 3.13 syntax is allowed.
* Use type hints for public functions and interview-relevant APIs.
* Keep functions short and named around intent.
* Prefer standard library solutions before third-party packages.
* Add tests for normal cases, edge cases, and failure cases.
* Use `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, and `pytest` as quality gates.
* Explain trade-offs in exercise notes when useful for interviews.

## Strictly Follow

* Minimize context consumption.
* Load the smallest context required.
* Use documentation as reference material, not startup material.
* Keep `Problems.md` as the master roadmap.
* Remove duplicated information rather than creating additional copies.
* Prefer incremental improvements over broad rewrites.
* Keep examples runnable from a fresh Conda environment.

## Context Protection Rules

Never:

* rewrite/update chat initial documents as `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` unless requested,
* create new documentation hierarchies without need,
* duplicate exercise requirements across multiple files,
* expand startup context,
* scan the entire repository without need,
* infer requirements not present in the user request or exercise material,
* add dependencies without updating `environment.yml`,
* solve future exercises unless explicitly asked.

---

Whenever you are asked to initialise new target (problem exercise):
- initialise by `just new-problem <number_name>` using the numbered exercise name from `Problems.md`, for example `002_temperature_converter`
- update the newly created problem's `solution.py` top-level comment/docstring with the problem description, requirements, examples, constraints or edge cases, implementation task, and interview focus
- do not implement the solution for the user; leave the exercise implementation as placeholders or minimal stubs for the user to complete
- add only small, simple baseline unit tests that define the expected public API and basic behavior; avoid exhaustive tests that effectively solve the whole exercise
- add just commands targeting the new problem: `test-xxx` and `run-xxx`
- keep the exercise self-contained and lightweight unless the user explicitly asks for a fuller implementation or documentation

When the user says a problem directory was already created with `just new-problem <number_name>`:
- do not run `just new-problem` again; treat the task as seed-file refinement only
- do not scan the repository to discover the problem files
- assume the standard seed paths exist:
  - `problems/<number_name>/solution.py`
  - `problems/<number_name>/tests/test_solution.py`
- read only those target files, plus the smallest necessary `Problems.md` context if the problem title or focus is needed
- if adding just commands, read only the root `justfile`
- do not inspect unrelated problem directories unless the user asks to follow an existing example
- keep generated tests intentionally small:
  - one API existence or import test
  - one basic successful behavior test
  - optionally one simple invalid-input test
- leave implementation placeholders in place unless the user explicitly asks for the solution
- baseline tests for unsolved exercises may fail until the user implements the solution; this is acceptable when failures point at the intended placeholder or missing behavior
